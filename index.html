        <h2>Personal 3D printing for the masses</h2>
               
        <p>
            Welcome to the AXIS 3D website. Here at AXIS 3D we want to make 3D printing truly accessible to everyone by making low-cost, high-quality, 3D printing more personalized and simple to understand.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            <em>AXIS 3D is a different type of 3D printing experience</em>
            One notable difference is that your experience at AXIS 3D will not be an automated process.
            We take the time to make sure that your order will be done right the first time.
            If you're new to 3D printing, settings can be hard which is why we help you through the process of figuring out your print!
        </p>
        <h2>How does the ordering from AXIS 3D work?</h2>
        <p>
            Ordering from AXIS 3D is easy! Simply visit our order page <a href="order/index.html">here</a>. 
            We'll ask you a few simple questions (name, email, type of print, filament choice) to make sure that we can serve you best. 
            We will follow up in a few hours time with some information (availability of filament, etc).
            And we'll also ask for a few more things (the file you want us to print, and confirmation of the order).
            We are with you at nearly every step of the way to help get you the best print that we can.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is your pricing like and how does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            We are able to beat any price because of lower costs! 
            Our prices generally run between 25-60% less than other shops because we aren't trying to support a physical location.
            Our pricing is based off of what we paid for the filament, so when we find filament half off we pull the trigger!
            That being said, we NEVER sacrifice quality. 
            Bad filament ruins YOUR peices, and OUR printers (nobody likes filament jams).
            A full pricing list can be found <a href="order/prices.html">here</a>. 
            While we don't have every color in stock, we WILL order filament for your prints! 
            We love having more colors to play around with!
        </p>
        <h2>We're not just printing, we're also designing!</h2>
     
        <h3>3D printers!</h3>
        <p>
            <em>AXIS 3D is currently designing a 3D printer of its own!</em> - 
            Design is still in the early stages, but the first sample parts will make their debuts soon. 
            The final revision will be complete before the summer of 2015, and will be available for sale later that year.
        </p>
        <h3>AXIS Library</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Predesigned and known to work</em> - 
            the AXIS Library will have a number of designs that can be printed and shipped almost immediately!
            The parts first parts to become part of the AXIS Library will be uploaded soon.
            You'll be able to purchase access to the files themselves as well as the final printed objects. 
            We hope to open up community designs to the website in the future as well.
